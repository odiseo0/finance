# Task List Management

We use this for creating and managing task lists in markdown files to track project progress

**Task list creation**
- Use `tasks.md` for relevant features or big tasks. Also is the feature is too big, create a file with a descriptive relevant name to the feature (e.g `ASSISTANT_CHAT.MD`) in the project root.
- Include a clear title and description of the feature being implemented

**Task structure**
If it's a new file, create it with the following structure, otherwise just add it to the current `tasks.md`

```markdown
# Feature Name Implementation

Brief description of the feature and its purpose.

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Task 1 that has been completed
- [x] Task 2 that has been completed

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Task 3 currently being worked on
- [ ] Task 4 to be completed soon

## Future Tasks

- [ ] Task 5 planned for future implementation
- [ ] Task 6 planned for future implementation

## Implementation Plan

Write a detailed of how the feature will be implemented

## Relevant Files

Relevants files should be named using the following format:
path/to/file.ext (@filename.ext)
Followed by a brief description of the file purpose

# Updating a Task

1. Update the task list as you progress:
   - Mark tasks as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`
   - Add new tasks as they are identified
   - Move tasks between sections as appropriate

2. Keep "Relevant Files" section updated with:
   - File paths that have been created or modified
   - Brief descriptions of each file's purpose
   - Status indicators (e.g., âœ…) for completed components

3. Add implementation details:
   - Architecture decisions
   - Data flow descriptions
   - Technical components needed
   - Environment configuration

## AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI should:

1. Regularly update the task list file after implementing significant components  
2. Mark completed tasks with `[x]` when finished  
3. Add new tasks discovered during implementation  
4. Maintain the "Relevant Files" section with accurate file paths and descriptions  
5. Document implementation details, especially for complex features  
6. When implementing tasks one by one, first check which task to implement next  
7. After implementing a task, update the file to reflect progress  

**Example Task Update**

When updating a task from "In Progress" to "Completed":
