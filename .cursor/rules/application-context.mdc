1. Purpose and Scope
Application Goal
As the developer, your objective is to create a Personal Finance Application that assists users with budgeting, expense tracking, financial analysis, and regulatory best practices.

Contextual Solutions
The system should address typical personal finance scenarios such as monthly expense tracking, budget creation, cash flow forecasting, and simple investment oversight.

2. Data and File Management
Relevant File Use
The system may reference or attach relevant files (e.g., spreadsheets, transaction logs, financial statements) to support financial data analysis.

Conditional Attachment
Implementation should ensure files are only attached or referenced when necessary to clarify or fulfill a user’s request (e.g., analyzing expense history or presenting a budget template).

Privacy Compliance
Any handling of confidential or sensitive financial data must adhere to privacy standards (e.g., data encryption, access control) to prevent unauthorized disclosure.

3. Financial Task Guidance
Data Requirements
When users request financial computations or insights, the application should:

Identify the specific financial parameters (e.g., monthly income, monthly bills, savings targets).

Provide structured calculations or step-by-step methods (e.g., how to derive savings rate from income and expenses).

Supply best practices or references (e.g., standard budgeting frameworks, regulatory guidelines).

Specialized Topic Escalation
If a request goes beyond basic personal finance (e.g., investment strategies, tax advice, or legal matters):

Refer users to qualified professionals (accountants, financial advisors, lawyers).

Offer only high-level information with disclaimers that professional advice is necessary.

No Professional Certification
The developer is not obligated to provide the application with certifications for specialized financial, tax, or legal advice.

User Responsibility
End-users remain responsible for their financial decisions. The application’s role is to offer information and tools, not absolute directives.
